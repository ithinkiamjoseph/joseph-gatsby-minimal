One interesting area of opportunity in web3 that hasn't gotten a lot of talk is with books.

Let me dream for a minute here:

Right now, with current tools and platforms, you can buy a digital book, but it doesn't have any resale value. That even sounds strange to think of. Why would a digital book have resale value?

But that's web2 thinking. Web3 can change that.

Imagine you buy an .epub book from a blockchain as an NFT. The author sold 500 copies of the book. You paid $10 or whatever the equal amount of ETH or BTC was. A few months later that author becomes huge and the book becomes super popular. You can actually prove that you were one of the first or maybe THE first to buy her book.

Now your NFT epub book has an actual value to it. You can actually resell it for a high cost or hold on to it because you want to keep it. And you have more of an incentive to make that author and book more popular because the more popular the book gets, the more valuable your NFT epub is.

### "Can't I just get the .epub file from someone else for free?"

Yes, you can. But that doesn't matter here. Your epub file you got from a friend has no value outside of just you reading it. And maybe that's all you want to do. That's fine. But you can't resell it because you can't prove you bought it. If you don't care about reselling it, then that's totally fine. Many people don't care about first edition books, some do.

As an author, this opens up a lot of potential. You can ditch Amazon completely and go post your book on any popular blockchain marketplace and they will only take a small percentage, usually 2.5%, instead of what Amazon would take which was anywhere from 30-65%.

An author could even take royalties on future purchases of her book by putting that in the smart contract. They could make different versions of the book with different prices. They could attach unique things to the NFT like a quick interview with them or a copy of their notes from when they were writing the book.
> NFTs make digital books act like physical books.

Let's dream even further into the future: a blockchain enabled e-reader.

You would be able to buy an e-reader that connects to the Ethereum/Solana/whatever blockchain. You log in using your metamask/fantom/whatever wallet secret code and bam, all your epub books show up and you can buy more using the built in web browser that can connect to the blockchain marketplaces.

### One Question: Why?

How is this better than clicking buy on a kindle book and showing up on my kindle in 5 seconds?

Right now it's not. Amazon makes things super easy. Web3 stuff is far from easy. Gas fees are high, there's tons of steps, and it's super confusing. We are far from web3 being something your neighbor-whose-iphone-still-has-a-homebutton will use.

One of the main reasons to get excited is decentralization. Amazon can kill your account whenever they want for whatever reason and all of your books are gone. This can't happen with web3.

This isn't to demonize Amazon. They give authors a huge platform and an easy way to reach millions of users. That's huge. And their cut can be somewhat-fair considering that they spent years building AWS.

But the internet is changing. People don't need big platforms anymore. They can sell direct to their fans.

Decentralization and proof of ownership via the blockchain make the digital space super exciting and interesting.

Putting power in the hands of the author is exciting.

But we aren't there yet. Gas fees are still high, the tech is still slow, it's difficult to understand, and we aren't sure which blockchains are going to dominate (Eth vs Sol).

Some people doing interesting stuff in this space right now: NFTBooks @nftbstoken and Published NFT @publishednft.

Hopefully some of this made sense and maybe got you a little excited about the possibilities of what is possible with web3. I like where things are headed, but we have some time until we get there.
